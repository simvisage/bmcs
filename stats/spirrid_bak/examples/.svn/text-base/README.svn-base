This directory provides the performance studies of the spirrid
integration tool. There are three types of response functions
tested:

The implementation of the generic integration algorithm
is given in mu_integ.py

 * fiber_tt_2p.py: fiber tensile test with 2 parameters 
   one strong discontinuity) 
 * fiber_tt_5p.py: fiber tensile test with 5 parameters
   one strong and one weak discontinuity
 * fiber_po_8p.py: fiber pullout test with 7 parameters
   one strong, one weak discontinuity 
   and nonlinear range within the response
