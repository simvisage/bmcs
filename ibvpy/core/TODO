	* dots_eval.py (UniformDomainTSE.new_resp_var): - the system
	matrices and vectors - actually only the n_dof is
	required. Anything should be calculated using arrays.

	* ts_examples/ts04_bar1d.py (line_domain): Put the finite-element
	specialization of tse to fets_eval the material points should be
	put to mats_eval. then the dots_eval is also a reasonable
	place. There is a quite a variaty of mappings applicable. Should
	there be a fe_domain as a spatial domain for discretized problems? 
	The fe_domain has a geometric interface 
	
	- identify a fets_eval associated with a specified position
	- additionally it should be able to get the integration cell box
	- global coordinate (given a local one) - used for varying field variables 
	- and for enrichments.
	- get the dof_map
	- get the piece of state_array belonging to the element.


	* spatial_domain.py (FELineDomain): element iterator - look into
	langtangen, if its worth to apply something from there.

	* spatial_domain / spatial_context how to propagate the state
	array through the time-step-evals? At the moment it is hung on the
	empty object sctx. (this is quite arbitrary, not a clean
	convention available). What is the performance penalty?

	* bc - time-function must be editable
