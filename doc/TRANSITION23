Issues that have encountered upon the transition from Python 2.7 to 3.5

- the implements directive is not working because the class advisors
  of the HasTraits class are not allowed anymore
  
- this results in assignment error when an interface was expected

- the Class trait is not supported any more. Is the Type class 
  a possible replacement?
  
- Installation of Canopy 2.1.9 - the python interpreter is hard    
  to find - .local/share/... 
  
- The package pyqt is not installed by default because of licence issues
  it must be installed manually
  
- sympy must be also installed in addition.
