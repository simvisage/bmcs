    "## Introduction\n",
    "The smeared crack models dates back to the 1960s. In the beginning it was assumed that the crack direction is fixed and the shear tractions across the crack were treated with the shear retention factors. Later in the research the rotation of axes of material orthotropy was taken into account and the rotating crack model was developed. However, the rotating crack model suffers stress locking which occurs in the finite element simulations at meshes not aligned with the crack directions. Furthermore, this phenomenon leads to misprediction of structural ductility and the failure pattern. \n",
    "When the material is in uncracked state, the overall response is linearly elastic and the crack strain is zero. A crack is initiated when the stress reaches the tensile strength of the material $f_t$. A constitutive law governing the stress evolution after the crack initiation is depicted as:\n",
    "\\begin{gather*}\n",
    "\\sigma = f^c(\\epsilon^c) \n",
    "\\end{gather*}\n",
    "Here, the cohesive stress is considered as the function of crack strain and the function $f^c$ is obtained from experiments. In real situations, microcrack have different sizes, shapes and orientations. They are not necessariy planar and their faces are rough. However, simplifications are needed for the purpose of modelling. Hence, an equivalent computational crack which is perfectly planar and its direction defined by a unit vector n is assumed. Furthermore, it is assumed that the crack opening and sliding are affected only by traction vector acting on the crack plane i.e by first order tensor:\n",

    "## Rotating Crack Models\n",
    "The assembly of the material stiffness matrix is identical to the fixed crack approach and the only difference is the coordinate transformation matrix $N_{cr}$ which is upgraded at every step and follows the principal axes rotation. In this model, the plane of the crack is allowed to rotate and is assumed to remain perpendicular to the direction of maximum principal strain. In the case of the physical crack lying in a certain plane, it is rightly to say that it cannot rotate but in the case of the propagation of the crack under general loading it can deviate from the original plane and can become non planar. Even in RCM, we lost coaxiality due to rotation but this can be overcome if we drop arbitrariness of the shear retention factor and the resulting shear stiffness imposes coaxiality of prinicipal stresses and strain. However, to impose coaxiality the following relation has to be satisfied:\n",

The crack strain $\\epsilon^{c}_{nn}$ can be obtained by the Newton Method and than by substitution of the results we obtain the stress tensor. To derive the tangent stiffness matrix tensor for the rotating crack model, first the internal equilibrium condition is converted into rate form. An important point to be kept in mind is that crack normal rotates and hence, the second order tensor $N = n \\otimes n$ is variable in time. This needs to be taken into account while differentiating. The Rotating crack mode is the simplest model to take into account the crack induced anisotopy within a framework close to continuum mechanics. However, it has some implications i.e. it is not thermodynamically consistent. Furthermore, in this approach the tangent stiffness remains constant only if tensor $N$ remains constant i.e. if the principal axis do not rotate and in some cases the unloading can also lose positive defiteness which leads to non physica instabilities.
